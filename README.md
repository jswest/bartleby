An AI-powered tool for processing document corpora and researching them with an agentic assistant--or in other words: Bartleby is a scrivener who might prefer not to. Made with love by [John West](https://github.com/jswest), [Brian Whitton](https://github.com/noslouch), and [Rob Barry](https://github.com/robbarry).

## Background

At the _Wall Street Journal_, we have found it useful to let an AI agent run wild in a SQLite database containing the extracted text from a bunch of documents. Bartleby is the toolkit for that.

It's split into two pieces that share a SQLite database:

- **The `bartleby` CLI** scribes (parses, chunks, embeds, and indexes) documents. It also exposes helper commands that agents use during research sessions. Run on its own, it gives you a rich, queryable corpus regardless of whether you ever point an agent at it.
- **The `bartleby` skill** (in [`./bartleby/skill`](./bartleby/skill)) is a skill you drop into Claude Code, Cowork, Goose, or another compliant agent harness. It tells your agent how to explore the database, save findings, and cite evidence. The skill is BYO-model: it works with any agent the harness supports.

A SQLite database binds these two together. The CLI writes it, the skill romps through it, writing findings back into it as it cavorts.

A couple things to be aware of:

- Token costs can add up. For ingestion, summarization and image description are the drivers (you can also turn either off or use local models). For research, costs are governed by whatever model you're running the skill against. If your hardware supports it, you can run everything locally, though (see below).
- This uses the excellent (but pre-v0) [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) plugin for SQLite. There might be some instability there.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```
brew install uv tesseract
```

(`apt install tesseract-ocr` on Debian/Ubuntu; on Windows, use the official installer from UB Mannheim.)

Tesseract is used for cheap OCR on scanned PDF pages before falling back to the more expensive VLM. The default PDF pipeline uses [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) for text and [pypdfium2](https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2) for page rendering — both are bundled as Python deps, no system install needed. [Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/) is available as an opt-in alternative PDF converter (slower, but more structurally aware) and as the default converter for HTML/MD. [sec2md](https://github.com/alphanome-ai/sec2md) is an opt-in HTML converter specialized for iXBRL EDGAR filings.

### Install Bartleby

From the project directory:

```
uv tool install .
```

This installs `bartleby` as a command-line tool in an isolated environment.

To opt into the Docling converter (slower, but layout-aware) — which you'll almost always want, since it's required to ingest `.md` and `.html` files:

```
uv tool install '.[docling]'
```

To opt into [sec2md](https://github.com/alphanome-ai/sec2md) for EDGAR iXBRL filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc.). sec2md preserves SEC table structure and section headings that Docling tends to flatten. It only activates when `html_converter = sec2md` *and* the file passes an iXBRL sniff (`xmlns:ix=...` in the head); everything else on the HTML branch still falls through to Docling.

```
uv tool install '.[sec2md]'
```

You can combine extras: `uv tool install '.[docling,sec2md]'`.

The wsjpt provider (routes Gemini through WSJ's parsing toolkit; WSJ-internal) is **not** in the locked dependency set — its git source is unreachable outside WSJ, which would break `uv lock`/`uv sync` for everyone. Inject it into the **tool's** environment with `--with` — extras and out-of-band packages have to go there, not a separate `uv pip install` (which lands somewhere the running tool can't see). `--force` re-applies to an already-installed tool:

```
uv tool install '.[docling,sec2md]' --with 'git+ssh://git@github.dowjones.net/data/wsjpt.git' --force
```

For development:

```
uv tool install --editable .
```

### Pinning to a release

The examples above install whatever `HEAD` you have checked out — fine for following along, but a moving target if you'd rather upgrade on your own schedule. Releases are git tags of the form `v0.<schema>.<patch>`, so you can pin to one directly without even cloning.

**Read the number first.** The **minor** *is* the database schema version. A minor bump (`v0.7.x` → `v0.8.0`) means the schema changed and existing corpora must be re-ingested; a patch bump (`v0.7.0` → `v0.7.1`) is always safe to take in place. So you can compare two tags and know instantly whether moving between them will cost you a re-ingest. (Maintainers: see [`scripts/release.py`](./scripts/release.py) for how tags are cut.)

To see what's available, browse the [releases page](https://github.com/jswest/bartleby/releases) or list the tags without cloning:

```
git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/jswest/bartleby.git 'v*'
```

Then pin to the one you want:

```
uv tool install 'git+https://github.com/jswest/bartleby.git@v0.7.0'
```

Extras and the `--with`/`--force` flags work the same as above. Versions are read straight from the tag, so `bartleby --version` always tells you exactly what you're running. (To pin with extras, see the `#egg=` form under [Upgrading from a release](#upgrading-from-a-release) below.)

### Upgrading from a release

When a newer release lands, moving to it is two pieces — the CLI and the skill — plus a quick check on the version number. (This is the pinned-release counterpart to [After updating Bartleby](#after-updating-bartleby), which covers riding `main`.)

**First, find the latest tag** — don't reuse a number from memory. Browse the [releases page](https://github.com/jswest/bartleby/releases), or:

```
git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/jswest/bartleby.git 'v*'
```

Compare its minor (middle) number to what `bartleby --version` currently reports: same minor → a safe in-place upgrade; a higher minor → the schema moved and you'll re-ingest (see below). Use the new tag wherever `<latest>` appears below.

**1. Reinstall the CLI at the new tag.** Repeat whatever extras you first used and add `--force` to replace the installed tool. The `#egg=bartleby[...]` fragment is how extras attach to a `git+https` URL — drop it and you get a working CLI with **no** Docling/sec2md, which silently breaks HTML/EDGAR ingestion (or falls back to weaker extraction). For SEC work, keep both:

```
uv tool install 'git+https://github.com/jswest/bartleby.git@<latest>#egg=bartleby[docling,sec2md]' --force
```

**2. Refresh the skill.** The skill now ships *inside* the package, so the CLI you just reinstalled already carries the matching version — `bartleby ready` stamps it straight into `~/.claude/skills/bartleby` with no separate checkout:

```
bartleby ready
```

Restart your harness afterward so it reloads the skill.

**If the new tag crossed a schema boundary** (its minor number is higher), existing projects need to be brought up to date before they'll open — see [After updating Bartleby](#after-updating-bartleby) for `bartleby project upgrade <name>` and the re-ingest case.

### Install the skill

The skill ships inside the package, so one command installs (or refreshes) it into your harness's skills directory:

```
bartleby ready
```

This stamps the skill that came with your installed `bartleby` into `~/.claude/skills/bartleby/`, **replacing any prior copy** so `SKILL.md` always lands *directly* under `~/.claude/skills/bartleby/` — never nested a level too deep:

```
~/.claude/skills/bartleby/
├── README.md
└── SKILL.md
```

Restart your harness after installing — skills load at startup. See the [`bartleby ready`](#bartleby-ready) command reference for the `--check` / `--force` / `--dest` flags, and [`./bartleby/skill/README.md`](./bartleby/skill/README.md) for harness-specific notes.

### Verify your install

```
which bartleby                          # the CLI is on PATH
bartleby --version                      # which version (or dev build) is installed
bartleby project list                   # the CLI actually runs
bartleby ready --check                  # the installed skill is present and current
```

WSJ users: once wsjpt is configured, `bartleby config` loads the provider with no `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'wsjpt'`.

### After updating Bartleby

This project moves fast. If you'd rather not ride `main`, [pin to a release tag](#pinning-to-a-release) and upgrade deliberately on your own schedule with [Upgrading from a release](#upgrading-from-a-release). Otherwise, after every `git pull`, refresh both pieces from the new code:

```
# 1. Reinstall the CLI (repeat whatever extras you first used)
uv tool install '.[docling,sec2md]' --force

# 2. Refresh the skill so your agent sees the current contract
bartleby ready
```

Restart your harness afterward so it reloads the skill. (Editable installs — `--editable .` — pick up code changes automatically, so you can skip step 1; `bartleby ready` still re-stamps the skill, and `--check` tells you whether a `git pull` actually changed it.)

**If the database schema changed**, existing projects won't open until they're brought up to date — a command will fail with a clear `schema version mismatch` message. Bring a project up to date with:

```
bartleby project upgrade <name>
```

Most updates upgrade in place. When a change isn't backward-compatible, `upgrade` tells you to **re-ingest** instead (recreate the project and run `bartleby scribe` again) — there's no automatic migration for those.

### Gotchas

- Don't keep the repo (or its `.venv`) in a synced folder like Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive — syncing rewrites file paths and quietly breaks the install.
- `bartleby` isn't on PyPI: run `uv` commands from inside the project directory — don't `uv pip install bartleby` or `uvx bartleby`.

### A note on first-run latency

Models download **lazily, the first time each is needed** — the `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` embedding model (~400 MB plus tokenizer assets) on your first `bartleby scribe` (and the skill's first `search`), and Docling's layout/OCR models on the first scanned/image PDF if you opted into `docling`. They're cached and reused; see [Model downloads and offline mode](#model-downloads-and-offline-mode) for caching paths and restricted-network behavior.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Configure

```
bartleby config
```

The setup wizard asks for LLM provider/model, API keys, summary depth, temperature, and the max token threshold for reading whole documents. Settings save to `~/.bartleby/config.yaml`.

![bartleby config: the interactive setup wizard walking through provider, model, and summarization settings.](./docs/demo.gif)

### 2. Create a project

```
bartleby project create foo
```

This creates a project directory (`foo` in this case) and marks it active. Subsequent commands use the active project unless you pass `--project`.

### 3. Ingest documents

```
bartleby scribe --files /path/to/your/docs
```

Point this at a file or directory of `.pdf`, `.html`, `.md`, `.txt`, or image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`); unrecognized extensions are content-sniffed and kept if they turn out to be a supported type (details under [`bartleby scribe`](#bartleby-scribe)). Bartleby extracts text, chunks it, generates embeddings, and (optionally) writes a one-shot summary per document. With a vision provider configured, embedded images and standalone image files are analyzed too (OCR + scene description) and folded into the same searchable index. Everything lands in the project's SQLite database.

### 4. Start an agent session

In your harness of choice, load the `bartleby` skill (install it first with `bartleby ready` — see [Install the skill](#install-the-skill)) and ask the agent a question about your corpus. The skill guides it through searching, reading, synthesizing, and citing.

The agent opens its own research *run* on its first call (`bartleby skill session new`) and carries it for the rest of the conversation, so **one conversation is one run** with no setup on your part — a new conversation is a new run. If you want the agent to ignore findings from prior runs (e.g. for a blind multi-model comparison), ask it to open the run with memory off:

```
bartleby skill session new --no-memory
```

(More on runs and memory in the skill README.)

### 5. Browse what you've got

```
bartleby serve
```

Spins up a local SvelteKit UI for the active project — a corpus overview, document and finding browsers, and full-corpus search, with inline citations that link into the source PDFs at the cited page (full tour under [`bartleby serve`](#bartleby-serve)). It opens the database read-only, so it's safe to leave running alongside an ingest or a research session. Requires Node.js and npm on `PATH`.

### 6. Share a single finding out of band

```
bartleby finding export <finding-id>            # writes <slug>.md (or pass --out PATH)
bartleby finding import path/to/finding.md      # into the active project (or --project)
```

`finding export` writes a self-describing Markdown artifact: a YAML front-matter block (title, description, and baked-in provenance — the source corpus, the original finding id, and the export date) followed by the body. The body's corpus citations are rewritten inline as inert `[corpus: <file> · p.<N>]` markers so the artifact stands alone on a machine that doesn't have the corpus. `finding import` parses such an artifact into a project through the normal finding write path, prepending the provenance as a header line to the body (there's no author/origin column, so origin lives in the text). Imported corpus citations stay inert markers — they are *not* re-resolved to local chunk ids — and the finding then renders like any other local finding. This is the lightweight, no-S3 alternative to `bartleby project publish` / `import` when you just want to hand one finding to someone.

---

## Architecture

The CLI ingests. The skill researches. The database acts as the API between them. Each piece can be replaced independently as long as the schema contract holds. The database is self-describing--schema version, embedding model, and `sqlite-vec` version live in a `meta` table inside the DB itself. The skill reads `meta` on startup and refuses to run against an incompatible database.

The core tables (see [`bartleby/db/schema.py`](./bartleby/db/schema.py) for the DDL):

| Table | What lives here |
| --- | --- |
| `documents` | One row per ingested file, deduped by content hash. |
| `summaries` | One row per `document` (1:1) — title, description, body, and (optional) `authored_date`. |
| `images` | One row per *unique* image, deduped by byte hash. The same icon embedded in five docs is one row. |
| `document_images` | Join: which images appear in which document, at which page. |
| `findings` | Agent-authored research notes from `save_finding`. Each owned by a `session`. |
| `sessions` | Agent research runs, with a memory flag, a self-reported model, and a `run_key` — the per-conversation UUID an agent mints to bind one run to one conversation. |
| `chunks` | Polymorphic — one row per embeddable text chunk regardless of source. `source_kind` is one of `'document'`, `'summary'`, `'finding'`, `'image'`. |
| `chunks_fts`, `chunks_vec` | Virtual tables shadowing `chunks` for full-text (FTS5) and vector (sqlite-vec) search. One query covers all four source kinds at once. |
| `audit_logs` | One row per skill-script call, scoped to a session. |
| `tags`, `document_tags` | A controlled vocabulary the user curates, with LLM-assisted assignment. Lets the agent slice the corpus by category (`search --tag ch`, `list_documents --tag nyseg --tag conedison`). |
| `meta` | Schema version + embedding model fingerprint; the skill refuses to start against an incompatible DB. |

Tag and finding curation lives on the skill surface, not the CLI: `bartleby skill <name>` (e.g. `bartleby skill add_tag`, `bartleby skill assign_tag`, `bartleby skill save_finding`) is the sanctioned human path for managing the vocabulary and the findings stored above.

The `chunks` table is polymorphic on purpose: documents, summaries, findings, and images all produce searchable text, and folding them into one indexed table means one search query covers all of it. The trade-off is that `chunks.source_id` isn't a foreign key to any specific table — discipline lives in the typed insert helpers in [`bartleby/db/chunks.py`](./bartleby/db/chunks.py).

---

## Project directory structure

```
~/.bartleby/projects/<name>/
├── bartleby.db       # everything: chunks, summaries, findings, sessions, audit log, images
└── archive/          # original document files, dedup'd by content hash
    ├── <doc_hash>/<doc_hash>.<ext>
    └── images/<img_hash>.jpg   # extracted figures, scanned page renders, standalone images
```

All queryable state lives in `bartleby.db`. Findings, audit logs, and agent-generated summaries are all stored as rows there — no sidecar files, no on-disk reports.

Set `BARTLEBY_HOME` to relocate this whole tree — `projects/`, `config.yaml`, and scratch — somewhere other than `~/.bartleby`. Useful for keeping more than one corpus root, for CI, or for sandboxing a tool/agent so it can't touch your live corpora.

## Command reference

### `bartleby config`

Interactive configuration wizard. Asks for:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LLM provider | anthropic | `anthropic`, `openai`, or `ollama` (plus `wsjpt`, WSJ-internal) |
| Model | varies by provider | Model name (e.g., `claude-haiku-4-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `qwen3-vl:30b`) |
| API key | — | Required for Anthropic/OpenAI; can also use env vars |
| Summary depth | `one-shot` | `none` or `one-shot` |
| Temperature | 0 | 0 = deterministic, 1 = creative |
| Reasoning effort | `low` | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, or `high` — how hard the model reasons before summarizing. Lower = fewer billed reasoning tokens and faster; plenty for summaries. Applies to OpenAI (gpt-5) and effort-capable Anthropic models; Ollama/wsjpt accept and ignore it. Only prompted when summary depth is `one-shot` |
| Max summarize tokens | 50000 | If a document exceeds this, only the first N tokens are summarized (with a note appended) |
| Summarize workers | 4 (cloud) / 1 (Ollama) | How many documents summarize in parallel after parsing. The LLM call is network-bound, so it runs as its own stage — raise it for a rate-tolerant cloud provider. A local Ollama provider auto-clamps to 1 and isn't prompted for a count (`OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` defaults to 1, so parallel requests only queue) |
| PDF converter | `pdfplumber` | `pdfplumber` (fast, default) or `docling` (slower, more structurally aware) |
| HTML converter | `docling` | `docling` (default; also handles `.md`) or `sec2md` (routes iXBRL EDGAR filings to sec2md, other HTML to docling) |
| Sparse-text threshold | 100 | Pages with fewer extracted chars are treated as scanned; OCR then VLM fallback |
| Parse workers | auto | How many documents to parse in parallel. `0` = auto (`min(CPU cores − 2 reserved, free RAM ÷ ~12 GB)`, the `PER_WORKER_GB` budget measured against peak pdfplumber RSS) — the auto-pick leaves a couple of cores for the OS so a long ingest doesn't saturate the machine; a value you set here can use every core. Workers recycle periodically to keep memory bounded. Raise for a faster bulk ingest on a big machine, lower if memory is tight |
| Vision provider | (off) | Off by default; opt in during the wizard. If enabled, choose `anthropic`, `openai`, or `ollama` (plus `wsjpt`, WSJ-internal) |
| Vision model | varies by provider | e.g., `claude-haiku-4-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `qwen3-vl:30b` |
| Max image dimension | 768 | Long-edge pixels before sending an image to the VLM |
| Min image dimension | 64 | Images with a shorter edge than this are skipped — avoids wasting VLM calls (and crashes) on thin slivers |
| Tesseract min confidence | 30 | Avg confidence (0-100) below which we fall back to the VLM on sparse pages |
| Caption workers | 4 (cloud) / 1 (Ollama) | How many images caption in parallel after parsing. VLM calls are network-bound, so this runs separately from parse workers — raise it for a rate-tolerant cloud provider. A local Ollama vision provider auto-clamps to 1 and isn't prompted for a count (`OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` defaults to 1, so parallel requests only queue) |
| Max read tokens | 50000 | Threshold above which the skill's `read_document` requires `--force` |

**API keys** can be provided in the config or via environment variables: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` (used by the wsjpt provider). For Ollama, configure the server URL (default `http://localhost:11434`) or set `OLLAMA_API_BASE`.

For local-only setups, see [Running fully local](#running-fully-local-for-sensitive-work) for the recommended model picks by hardware tier.

Config saves to `~/.bartleby/config.yaml`.

### `bartleby ready`

Install or refresh the skill into your agent harness. Stamps the skill bundled with your installed `bartleby` into `~/.claude/skills/bartleby/` (or `--dest <dir>`), replacing any prior copy so `SKILL.md` lands directly under it. "Latest" is decided by a content hash over the skill files — not the version number — because `SKILL.md` is edited between releases, so re-running is a no-op only when the bundled skill genuinely matches what's installed.

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| (none) | Install or refresh if the installed copy differs from the bundled one; no-op if already current. |
| `--check` | Report status and exit non-zero if missing or stale; writes nothing. |
| `--force` | Reinstall even when already up to date. |
| `--dest <dir>` | Install into a different skill directory. |

Restart your harness afterward — skills load at startup.

### `bartleby project`

Manage project workspaces. Each project gets its own database and document archive.

```
bartleby project create <name>    # Create and activate a new project
bartleby project list             # List all projects
bartleby project use <name>       # Switch active project
bartleby project info [name]      # Show project details
bartleby project delete <name>    # Delete a project and all its data (--yes to skip prompt)
bartleby project upgrade <name>   # Apply additive schema upgrades to an existing DB
```

The default policy is "no backwards compat" — schema bumps mean re-ingest. The one allowed relaxation is *additive-only* upgrades (new tables, indexes, nullable columns), which ship with an entry in [`bartleby/db/upgrades.py`](./bartleby/db/upgrades.py) so existing corpora can opt in via `bartleby project upgrade <name>` instead of re-ingesting. Non-additive bumps still force a re-ingest; the upgrade command refuses them.

### `bartleby scribe`

Ingest HTML, MD, PDF, and TXT documents into the project database.

```
bartleby scribe --files <path> [<path> ...] [options]
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--files <path> [<path> ...]` | One or more files and/or directories of supported documents (required). Directories are walked recursively; a file reachable from more than one path is ingested once. |
| `--only <type>` | Restrict ingestion to the given file type(s): `pdf`, `html`, `md`, `txt`, `image`. Repeatable and/or comma-separated (e.g. `--only pdf,html`). Filters on the *resolved* type, so a content-sniffed PDF with no extension is kept by `--only pdf`. |
| `--project <name>` | Target project (defaults to active) |
| `--model <name>` | Override LLM model for summarization |
| `--provider <name>` | Override LLM provider |
| `--pdf-converter <name>` | Override PDF converter (`pdfplumber` or `docling`) |
| `--html-converter <name>` | Override HTML converter (`docling` or `sec2md`) |
| `--verbose` | Show debug output |
| `--timings` | Benchmark mode: time each document's parse/embed/caption/summarize stages, print the per-doc split to stderr, and emit an aggregate (docs/sec, pages/sec, per-stage breakdown) as JSON to stdout. Off by default — normal ingest is unchanged. |

**Supported file types:** `.pdf`, `.html`/`.htm`, `.md`, `.txt`, image files (`.jpg`/`.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`/`.tif`). The type is taken from the extension when it is one of these; a missing or unrecognized extension is resolved by sniffing the file's magic bytes instead. A recognized extension is always trusted as-is — content never overrides it — so a `.txt` that happens to hold PDF bytes stays text.

Ingestion runs in three concurrent phases — parse (a process pool), image caption, and summarize (each its own worker pool, sized by the wizard settings above) — all feeding a single writer that owns the database connection. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the single-writer drain and how a run resumes by what's missing.

**Pipeline:**

1. Hashes and archives the source file at `archive/<hash>/<hash>.<ext>` (dedup by content).
2. Converts and chunks:
   - `.pdf`: pdfplumber by default — per-page text extraction; embedded images are extracted via page-render-crop. Pages whose extracted text is below `sparse_text_threshold` are treated as scanned: Tesseract OCR runs first (cheap), and only if confidence is below `ocr_min_confidence` does the page get routed to the VLM.
   - `.pdf` with `--pdf-converter docling`: layout-aware, structural extraction with internal OCR for image-based PDFs.
   - `.html`, `.htm`, `.md`: Docling by default (requires the `[docling]` install). With `--html-converter sec2md`, each HTML file is sniffed for the iXBRL namespace — matches route to sec2md (preserves SEC tables + section headings); non-matches still go through Docling. `.md` always goes through Docling.
   - `.txt`: read as UTF-8, simple character chunker — *unless* it's an EDGAR full-submission file (detected by its `<SEC-DOCUMENT>`/`<SEC-HEADER>` SGML envelope, regardless of extension). Those are unwrapped into their inner `<DOCUMENT>` blocks: each HTML/iXBRL body is routed to sec2md (so the `[sec2md]` install is required for these), plain-text exhibits go through the character chunker, and graphics / XBRL data files are skipped. The whole submission lands as a single document. Note this overrides the `html_converter` setting for inner HTML — sec2md is the only converter that reads SEC HTML, and the alternative here is raw SGML tag soup, so the dependency is hard. (Standalone EDGAR `.htm` files are unaffected: they still honor `html_converter` and only use sec2md when you opt in.)
   - Image files: routed directly to the VLM. OCR transcription and scene description are stored as separate chunks (`content_type='image_ocr'` and `'image_description'`).
3. Computes a `tiktoken` token count for the document.
4. Generates vector embeddings (BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, 768 dims).
5. Generates a one-shot, whole-document summary per document (if summary depth is `one-shot`). The summarizer enforces structured JSON output across all providers (anthropic, openai, ollama) via Pydantic. The same call also extracts an optional `authored_date` (ISO 8601) if the document states one; malformed or ambiguous dates store as NULL.
6. For documents longer than `max_summarize_tokens`, the summarizer runs on the first N tokens only and a deterministic note is appended to the saved summary.
7. Stores everything in SQLite with full-text search (FTS5) and vector search (sqlite-vec). Images dedupe at the byte level — the same icon embedded in five docs is one VLM call, not five.

**Ingest is restartable.** Each document's parse (text + embeddings), each image caption, and the summary are committed as independent units, so an interrupted run — a crash, a Ctrl-C, a VLM that goes down mid-corpus — loses no completed work. Re-run the same `bartleby scribe` command and it resumes by what's *missing*: a document that died after its text landed but before its images were captioned re-captions only those images; it never re-parses or re-captions finished images, and a fully-ingested file is skipped. A unit that keeps failing is retried a few times, then recorded and **left out rather than retried forever** — those incomplete units are reported at the end of the run and counted under "Failed units" in `bartleby project info`, so a skipped caption never quietly passes for a complete document. A run that ends with any unit still unresolved **exits non-zero** — the only machine-readable signal a scripted caller (`bartleby scribe ... && next-step`) has — so a run that ingested nothing can't read as green; a fully successful run, including a no-op resume, exits 0.

_N.B._: For a sample corpus with 12 documents at 51MB total--a mix of academic, news, and regulatory PDFs--with a good number of images, it took ~2 minutes per document running with entirely local models. Shorter documents with fewer images will perform _much_ faster. Long documents with lots of images are slower. For example, a ~200-page regulatory document with lots of fine print and 23 images took ~5 minutes to embed, describe the images, and summarize. A five-page news article with a single image took ~30 seconds.

**Benchmarking ingest.** `--timings` turns the run into a repeatable measurement, timing each document's stages and emitting a per-stage aggregate as JSON to stdout (the bar and prose stay on stderr, so capture it with a redirect). The reproducible recipe — fresh-project setup, the aggregate JSON field reference, the gotchas that silently corrupt a run, and recorded runs — lives in [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

### `bartleby session`

Manage agent sessions. Sessions are first-class rows in the database; findings and audit log entries are tagged with a `session_id`.

```
bartleby session start [--no-memory] [--harness <name>] [--model <id>]   # Start a new session
bartleby session current                                                 # Show the active session
bartleby session end                                                     # End the active session (cosmetic)
bartleby session set [--harness <name>] [--model <id>]                   # Stamp the active session's backend
```

**Most users will never run `bartleby session start`.** If no session is active when the skill calls a script, the skill auto-creates one with default settings (memory on). You only need to start a session explicitly if you want `--no-memory`.

The `--no-memory` flag creates a session that cannot read findings from prior sessions. This is enforced at the script level — the skill's `search` script returns no findings when called against a memory-off session, regardless of how the agent is prompted.

`--harness` / `--model` record which backend authors the session's findings, so a corpus built across multiple models/harnesses stays self-describing (the values show up in `list_findings` / `read_finding`). `--harness` is best-effort auto-detected (e.g. Claude Code) when omitted; `--model` usually has no environment signal, so declare it explicitly or stamp it after the fact with `bartleby session set`. Unknown values stay null — never guessed. This is most useful when you start a session yourself before pointing an agent at the corpus; for blind multi-model comparison, leave them unset at start and `session set` them after assessing.

### `bartleby embed`

Embed a string and print the resulting vector as JSON. Used by the skill's `search` script during semantic search; rarely called directly.

```
bartleby embed "your query here"
```

### `bartleby logs`

View the audit log for a session. Useful when an agent does something weird and you want to see what tools it called.

```
bartleby logs [--session <name>] [--limit <n>]
```

If no session is specified, shows the most recent session's logs.

### `bartleby serve`

Launch a local SvelteKit UI for browsing *and searching* the active project — findings, documents, and full corpus search, with inline citations that link straight into the archived PDFs at the right page.

```
bartleby serve
bartleby serve --project <name>   # browse a different corpus without switching the active one
```

Five top-level views (plus a per-chunk view reached from citations and search hits):

- `/` — a corpus overview for the active project (the same aggregate the agent's `describe_corpus` returns): document / chunk / token totals, the authored-date range shown with its undated count, a documents-by-year histogram, summary coverage, content mix, tag chips, and the largest documents — plus nav cards into findings and documents.
- `/search` — search the whole corpus using the same engine the agent uses. **Search** mode fuses full-text + semantic ranking (RRF) across documents, summaries, findings, and images; **Scan** mode enumerates *every* chunk matching a literal phrase, paginated. Filter by source kind, tag, and document scope; expand any hit to its full text or open the source file at the cited page. Each hit's `chunk N` carries a small open-in-context icon → its `/chunks/<id>` view. (Semantic queries load the embedding model per request, so the first hit takes a few seconds — the page shows a loading state.)
- `/findings` — every saved finding, newest first. Click through to a split view: the finding's body (markdown, with inline citation chips) on the left, the source PDF on the right. Clicking a chip jumps the viewer to the cited page; the small icon beside it opens that chunk's `/chunks/<id>` view.
- `/documents` — the ingested corpus, filterable by authored-date range (with an include-undated toggle) and tag, sortable by title / date / ingest order, and paginated. Each row shows its assigned tag chips (hover a chip for the tag's description); when a date filter hides undated documents it says how many and offers to show them. Click through to a split view: the one-shot summary on the left, the original document on the right (PDFs in the browser's native viewer with `#page=` jumps; markdown rendered to formatted HTML; everything else in a sandboxed frame).
- `/tags` — the controlled tag vocabulary: every tag with its description and document count. Click a tag to see the documents carrying it.
- `/chunks/<id>` — a single chunk in context: the chunk itself at full contrast, its two neighbors on each side (same source, by chunk index) muted as surrounding context, and a link back to the source document (or finding). Reached from the icon beside any chunk reference in findings and search results.

![Findings (`/findings`): the saved finding's body on the left with inline citation chips, the source PDF on the right at the cited page.](./docs/serve-findings.png)

![Documents (`/documents`): the ingested corpus with authored-date and tag filters, sorting, and paging — each row showing its file name, page count, and one-shot summary.](./docs/serve-documents.png)

Requires Node.js and npm on `PATH`. The first invocation runs `npm install` once into `~/.bartleby/serve/`; subsequent runs skip it. Browsing opens the project database read-only; the corpus overview, document listing, and search delegate to the skill scripts (`describe_corpus`, `list_documents`, `search`, `scan`, `read_chunks`) as subprocesses under a dedicated, memory-enabled `web-reader` session — so the views show exactly what the agent sees, findings are searchable, and the web never disturbs whichever session an agent has active. It picks up the active project from `~/.bartleby/config.yaml`, so `bartleby project use <name>` followed by a page reload switches what you're looking at. To browse a different corpus without disturbing the persisted active project, pass `bartleby serve --project <name>` — the override applies to that server only. It's safe to leave running alongside an ingest or a research session.

### `bartleby benchmark`

Pick the best local Ollama model for the document summarizer — and keep the
choice honest as your installed models change. A re-runnable selection tool:
`summarize` appends runs across every model × document, `judge` scores them
with a blind cloud judge, and `leaderboard` ranks the results; `blind` and
`errors` support spot-checking. Evidence accumulates in append-only stores, so
re-run any stage and the picture sharpens.

```
bartleby benchmark summarize   # append summarize runs (every model × document)
bartleby benchmark judge       # top up blind cloud-judge scores
bartleby benchmark leaderboard # the ranked report (--output writes CSV)
bartleby benchmark blind       # blinded summaries + key for a human spot-check
bartleby benchmark errors      # failed runs, with raw-output previews
```

Run from the repo root (or pass `--benchmarks-dir`). The full recipe — configs,
stores, and provenance — lives in [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md).

## Supported LLM providers (for ingest summarization)

| Provider | Default LLM | Default VLM | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic | `claude-haiku-4-5` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Requires API key. Structured output via tool-use. |
| OpenAI | `gpt-5-mini` | `gpt-5-mini` | Requires API key. Structured output via the SDK's Pydantic parse helper. |
| Ollama | `qwen3-vl:30b` | `qwen3-vl:30b` | Local server. Structured output via the chat API's `format=` JSON schema. One MoE model handles both jobs; `gemma4:e2b` is a lighter alternative (see [Picking models for your hardware](#picking-models-for-your-hardware)). |
| wsjpt | `fast` | `fast` | Out-of-band install (`uv pip install 'git+ssh://git@github.dowjones.net/data/wsjpt.git'`; not in the locked deps — WSJ-internal git source). Routes Gemini via WSJ's [parsing toolkit](https://github.dowjones.net/data/wsjpt) so model aliases (`fast` / `smart` / `smartest`) resolve centrally — no concrete model names in bartleby config. WSJ-internal install. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `wsjpt_api_key` in config); without one, wsjpt falls back to Vertex AI via ADC. |

The same provider list is used for both ingest-time summarization (the LLM) and image analysis (the VLM). You can mix providers — e.g. OpenAI for summaries, local Ollama for image analysis — or run the same one for both. Research at the agent layer is governed by whatever model your harness is running the `bartleby` skill against, not by these settings.

## Tech stack

- **Storage:** SQLite with FTS5 (full-text) and [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) (vector). One file per project.
- **Embeddings:** [`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) via `sentence-transformers`. 768 dimensions, ~400 MB on first download.
- **PDF text + image extraction:** [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) (text per page, image bounding boxes), [pypdfium2](https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2) (page rendering for OCR + image crops).
- **OCR:** [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/) via `pytesseract`. Cheap first pass for sparse pages.
- **VLM for image analysis:** pluggable — Anthropic / OpenAI / Ollama. Schema-enforced (Pydantic) JSON across providers, like the summarizer.
- **Opt-in alternative PDF converter:** [Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/) for layout-aware extraction with internal OCR. Activate via `--pdf-converter docling`. Required for HTML/MD ingest regardless of which PDF converter is selected.
- **Opt-in alternative HTML converter for SEC filings:** [sec2md](https://github.com/alphanome-ai/sec2md) (Apache 2.0) for iXBRL EDGAR filings. Activate via `--html-converter sec2md`; only routed to for files whose first 4 KB contain the iXBRL namespace marker, so a directory mixing 10-Ks with ordinary HTML still does the right thing per file.
- **Token counting:** `documents.token_count` is computed with `tiktoken`'s `cl100k_base` encoder regardless of which LLM provider you're using. A rough estimate — accurate enough for the `read_document --force` gate, not authoritative across providers.

## Running fully local (for sensitive work)

Bartleby is built to run end-to-end without an internet connection — the path for journalists working with sensitive material. Two pieces, both pointed at the same local Ollama:

1. **Ingest** — Run `bartleby config`, set `provider: ollama` (and `vision_provider: ollama` if you want image analysis), and pick a model your hardware can run.
2. **Research** — Install [Goose](https://goose-docs.ai/) (Apache 2.0; originally Block's, now governed by the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation) and point it at the same local Ollama. Goose reads Anthropic's Agent Skills format from `~/.claude/skills/`, so the `bartleby ready` install you'd do for Claude Code works unchanged. If you have Ollama, you can run [Pi](https://pi.dev), which is also excellent with `ollama launch pi --model <model-slug>`.

No prompts, source text, or research notes leave the machine.

### Picking models for your hardware

| Hardware | Ingest (summarization and tagging) | Ingest (VLM) | Research (Goose or Pi) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 64 GB+ unified memory | `gpt-oss:120b` or `qwen3:30b` | `qwen3-vl:30b` | `gpt-oss:120b` or `qwen3.6:35b-mlx` |
| ~32 GB unified memory | `gpt-oss:20b` | `gemma4:e2b` (Can occasionally stall on structured-output JSON reparses, which shows up as an apparently slow run rather than an error.) | `gpt-oss:20b` |

`qwen3.6:35b-mlx` is fine for research but **not** for ingest summarization — it failed the summarizer's structured-JSON contract 10/10 in testing (`docs: 0`); see [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md#gotchas-that-silently-corrupt-a-run).

**A note on model quality.** Local models follow tool-use protocols less reliably than frontier cloud models. Bartleby's research loop (search → read → cite → save) asks the model to track `chunk_id`s and cite them accurately; smaller models sometimes drop or hallucinate them. They can also format them incorrectly, which is super annoying. `gpt-oss:120b` is reasonably disciplined; with `gpt-oss:20b` you'll want to spot-check.

If you can't fit either tier, the middle path is **local ingest + cloud research**: keep `provider: ollama` for the deterministic ingest pipeline, but point Goose or Pi (or Claude Code) at a frontier API for the agent layer. Source documents still never leave the machine; only the agent's queries do.

### Sandboxing Pi in an isolated VM

Pi is a minimal harness with an unsandboxed `bash` tool — handing a local model a shell on your machine. To keep that off your Mac, [`docs/pi-vm-runbook.md`](docs/pi-vm-runbook.md) walks through running Pi (plus `decant` for web fetches) inside an isolated Apple `container` VM that mounts only your corpus: the big agent model stays on the host GPU, `decant`'s small distill model runs CPU-only inside the box, and helper scripts live in [`scripts/pi-vm/`](scripts/pi-vm/).

### Model downloads and offline mode

Bartleby pulls a few models from the Hugging Face Hub on demand: the embedding model (always), and — when you ingest with the Docling converter — Docling's layout and table models (the first time a conversion needs them). They cache under `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` and download once.

To avoid a Hub network check on every run, Bartleby switches Hugging Face into offline mode automatically — but only once *every* model the current run needs is already cached. Until then it stays online so the missing model can download. If you ever hit a model fetch that's blocked by offline mode, re-run with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=0` to force the download; an explicit `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` in your environment always overrides Bartleby's default.

## What's the `bartleby` skill?

A skill bundle (installed with `bartleby ready`) that teaches the agent how to use this database. It exposes a small set of scripts (`search`, `read_document`, `save_finding`, etc.) and a `SKILL.md` that codifies an opinionated research methodology — what counts as evidence, when to read a full document vs. searching, how to cite.

See [`./bartleby/skill/README.md`](./bartleby/skill/README.md) for the full story.

## Contributing

Bartleby is built hand-in-hand with Claude Code, and the workflow that makes that
work — the `/ship` issue→PR loop (leaf issues and omnibus bundles alike), the
worktree convention, the commit gates, the safety hook — is version-controlled
right in the repo. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for how we develop here (and how to do it by
hand if you'd rather). Architectural invariants and the decision log live in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
