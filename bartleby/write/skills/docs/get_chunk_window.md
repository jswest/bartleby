Read a window of text around a specific search hit.

Use this when you find a relevant chunk via search and need more surrounding context. Provide the `chunk_id` from any search result to grab nearby text (default ~3 chunks on either side, roughly 2400 characters total).

**When to use:**
- A search result looks relevant but is truncated
- You need to understand the context around a key finding
- You want to read a continuous passage without fetching the entire document
